# Text-Processing

The methods in this file are basic functions for text processing and they all have good performance. I share part of my accumulation and update this module constantly.

Now, there are two py files. One contains many basic functions which are very useful. Another is used for IO operaton, you can call those functions to read or write txt, xls, xlsx and csv files. I maintain that the methods in those functions are enough to meet various requirements!

Welcome to correct my mistakes and give me some adivice!
